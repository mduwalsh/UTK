<!---In November 1994, Netscape completed the design for SSL version 1.0. But version 1.0 was never publicly released because it had serious security flaws in the protocol. Only few months later in February 1995, much improved ssl protocol was released as SSL version 2.0. SSL version 2.0 also contained a number of security issues which ultimately led to the design of SSL version 3.0. SSL version 3.0 was released in 1996 by Netscape and Paul Kocher with complete redesign of the protocol and it eliminates lot of security flaws in previous versions. Newer versions of SSL/TLS are based on SSL 3.0. After May 1996, Internet Engineering Task Force (ietf) took responsibility of SSL development. itef renamed ssl to Transport Layer Security (TLS) in order to avoid showing of bias toward any particular company and first version of TLS was released in January 1999.
Despite change in names, TLS is just a new version of SSL. Actually there are far fewer differences between TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 than there are between SSL 3.0 and SSL 2.0. TLS 1.0 includes a means by which its implementation can downgrade the connection to SSL 3.0 and thus weakening security.-->

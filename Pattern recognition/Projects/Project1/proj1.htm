<h3> Project 1 - Two Category Classification Using Baysian Decision
Rule (Due 09/17--&gt;09/22)</h3>

<h4>Matlab Code for Plotting:</h4>

implementation for all three cases of the discriminant function with
Gaussian pdf, along with the testing code. This is just a reference. Feel free to develop your own.

<h4>Objectives:</h4>

Design a decision rule on a synthetic data set with two categories. Assume the probability density is Gaussian.

<h4>Data set used:</h4>
Download <i>synth.tr</i> (the training set) and <i>synth.te</i> (the test set) from the course url.

<h4>(80) Basic requirements:</h4>
Use synth.tr to train your decision rule, and use synth.te to test the decision rule.

<ul>
<li>(10/5) Use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the
  parameters of the Gaussian

</li><li>(30/20) Use likelihood ratio to derive your decision rule. 
Illustrate the decision rule as well as the sample locations (use 
different symbols for different categories) on the same graph. 

</li><li>(15/10) Use discriminant function (try all three cases) to derive
  your decision rule. Illustrate the three decision rules in the above
  figure and comment on the difference. (Note that the decision
  boundary from case III should be the same as the one you derived
  using likelihood ratio.)

</li><li>(10/10) Try different prior probability distributions and evaluate
  the performance. 
  
</li><li>(15/15) Evaluate the performance of your decision rule 
extensively. Some methods include calculation and comparison of the 
classification accuracy of applying different decision rules on the 
testing set.
</li></ul>

</li><li>(+15/20) Use two-modal Gaussian to model the data set and compare the performance with that using the one-modal.


<h4>(20) Report</h4>
Each project requires a formal and comprehensive report. Reporting is
especially important to graduate students. Here's a <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/%7Eqi/ece471-571/project/report_sample.htm">suggested outline</a> for your reference.

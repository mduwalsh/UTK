<h3> Project 3 - Classification Using Non-Parametric Density
Estimation and Performance Evaluation - Due 10/27/14</h3>

<h4>Basic requirement (80)</h4> 
<ul>
<li>Task 1 (40 pts): Implement kNN
<ul>
  <li>(20 pts) Basic implementation
</li><li>(5 pts) The implementation should be able to flexibly change the value of "k"
</li><li>(5 pts) The implementation should be able to measure the run time
</li><li>(10 pts)Implement partial distance and compare that with the original
  implementation in terms of run time and accuracy
</li></ul>
</li><li>Task 2 (20 pts): Experimenting kNN using the pima dataset
<ul>
<li>(12 pts) Apply kNN on nX, tX, and fX (refer to project 2) and 
compare the performance with that from project 2 from both computational
 time and accuracy perspectives
</li><li>(8 pts) For each appliation, try different values of k, e.g., k=1,
  5, and sqrt(n). Use Euclidean and other Minkowski distance of
  different degrees.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Task 3 (20 pts):  Use the "fglass" data set. Experimenting 
cross-validation with kNN as the classifier. Try out different k's. 
Based on the performance from cross-validation, determine the best k for
 this data set. You need to get enough samples of k between 1 and 
sqrt(n), e.g., 1, 5...15, and sqrt(n).
<ul>
</ul>

<h4>Report (20)</h4>

<h4>Bonus (+15)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Design and implement methods other than discussed in class to
reduce the computational load of kNN. Show the time spent and the
storage used in the new implementation.

</li></ul>

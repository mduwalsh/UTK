The dataset we've chosen for this the project is vehicle silhouettes. Vehicle recognition has been used for decades now and been used in various fields in real world. Since shape and design of each brand of vehicle are different than others, silhouettes formed by different types of vehicle in 2D image have different properties depending upon the type of vehicle. Specific properties of shape features measures of the image can be studied to gain knowledge about which vehicle the image belongs to. So identifying vehicle type which is 3D based on the shape features extracted from 2D image with all possible angles forms a very good pattern classification problem. Vehicle recognition has been used in different areas. It can be used for solving criminal cases. It can be used as tool for data mining or statistics of vehicle type in specific location. This can also be used in advertising market.

The purpose of the dataset is collected to classify silhouette presented as one of four types of vehicle, using  a set of features extracted from the silhouette where vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.

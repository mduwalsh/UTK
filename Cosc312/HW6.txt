Updated slides are attached.  Also, homework pertains to slide 30
("CFL not closed under intersection"):

1) Give a CFG for the Language A
2) Give a CFG for the Language B
3) Show A intersect B is as claimed
4) Use the pumping lemma to show the intersection above is not a CFL
5) Conclude that CFL are not closed under intersection
6) Show that consequently -- since they are closed under union --
   they cannot be closed under complementation.

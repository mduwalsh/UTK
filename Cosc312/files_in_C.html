<H1>Reading And Writing Files in C</H1>

<P><BR><P><H3>Fundamentals</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In C, you access files through a variable called a "file pointer".  A file
pointer is a variable of type <TT>FILE</TT>.  Here's how you declare a file
pointer:

<PRE>
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   
   int main(void)
   {
      FILE *fp;
   
      return 0;
   }
</PRE>

The variable <TT>*fp</TT> can point to a file.

<P><BR><P><H3>Opening A File</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In the above code, we declared the variable, but it doesn't point to anything
yet.  Here's how you make it point to a file called "results.dat" that you
intend to write to:

<PRE>
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   
   int main(void)
   {
      FILE *fp;
   
      fp = fopen("results.dat", "w");
   
      return 0;
   }
</PRE>

The <TT>w</TT> stands for "write".  Here's how you would open a file to read
from it:

<PRE>
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   
   int main(void)
   {
      FILE *fp;
   
      fp = fopen("results.dat", "r");
   
      return 0;
   }
</PRE>

and this is how you open a file named "results.dat" to append data to it:

<PRE>
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   
   int main(void)
   {
      FILE *fp;
   
      fp = fopen("results.dat", "a");
   
      return 0;
   }
</PRE>

For various reasons, it's possible that the call to <TT>fopen()</TT> can fail.
It's always wise to make sure the file was opened correctly and if it doesn't,
to quit the program.  Here's how you would do that:

<PRE>
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   
   int main(void)
   {
      FILE *fp;
   
      fp = fopen("results.dat", "w");
      if (fp == NULL) {
         printf("I couldn't open results.dat for writing.\n");
         exit(0);
      }
   
      return 0;
   }
</PRE>

Note that the <TT>exit()</TT> function requires the header file
<TT>stdlib.h</TT> to be included.
</BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><BR><P><H3>Writing To A File</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Now you know how to declare a file pointer and have it point to a file.   Let's
take a look at how you write to the file.  We'll write a list of numbers and
their squares into <TT>results.dat</TT> in a format suitable for plotting with
gnuplot:

<PRE>
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   
   int main(void)
   {
      FILE *fp;
      int i;
   
      fp = fopen("results.dat", "w");
      if (fp == NULL) {
         printf("I couldn't open results.dat for writing.\n");
         exit(0);
      }
   
      for (i=0; i&lt;=10; ++i)
         fprintf(fp, "%d, %d\n", i, i*i);
   
      return 0;
   }
</PRE>

We use the <TT>fprintf()</TT> to write to the file.  It works exactly like
<TT>printf()</TT> except the first argument is the file pointer, <TT>fp</TT>
which points to the file we're writing to.

</BLOCKQUOTE>





<P><BR><P><H3>Closing A File</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>After you're finished writing to the file, the last step is to close the
file.  You do that with the <TT>fclose()</TT> function.  This is a fully
functioning example of how you write to a file:

<PRE>
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   
   int main(void)
   {
      FILE *fp;
      int i;
   
      /* open the file */
      fp = fopen("results.dat", "w");
      if (fp == NULL) {
         printf("I couldn't open results.dat for writing.\n");
         exit(0);
      }
   
      /* write to the file */
      for (i=0; i&lt;=10; ++i)
         fprintf(fp, "%d, %d\n", i, i*i);
   
      /* close the file */
      fclose(fp);
   
      return 0;
   }
</PRE>

and that's it.  That's how you write files in C.  Here's the contents of
<TT>results.dat</TT>:

<PRE>
   0, 0
   1, 1
   2, 4
   3, 9
   4, 16
   5, 25
   6, 36
   7, 49
   8, 64
   9, 81
   10, 100
</PRE>

You can now plot this using gnuplot with:

<PRE>
   p@satan% gnuplot
   
   Terminal type set to 'x11'
   gnuplot&gt; plot 'results.dat'
<PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>




<P><BR><P><H3>Appending To A File</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

As an example of appending to an already existing file, let's add one more line
to our file of squares:

<PRE>
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   
   int main(void)
   {
      FILE *fp;
      int i = 11;
   
      /* open the file */
      fp = fopen("results.dat", "a");
      if (fp == NULL) {
         printf("I couldn't open results.dat for appending.\n");
         exit(0);
      }
   
      /* write to the file */
      fprintf(fp, "%d, %d\n", i, i*i);
   
      /* close the file */
      fclose(fp);
   
      return 0;
   }
</PRE>

Don't forget to use <TT>a</TT> in the call to <TT>fopen()</TT>!  If you use
<TT>w</TT> instead of <TT>a</TT>, you'll destroy the previous contents of
<TT>results.dat</TT>!

</BLOCKQUOTE>





<P><BR><P><H3>Reading From A File</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The last thing I'll go over is how to read from a file.  Here's how you would
read the file <TT>results.dat</TT> and print it to the screen:

<PRE>
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   
   int main(void)
   {
      FILE *fp;
      int i, isquared;
   
      /* open the file */
      fp = fopen("results.dat", "r");
      if (fp == NULL) {
         printf("I couldn't open results.dat for reading.\n");
         exit(0);
      }
   
      while (fscanf(fp, "%d,%d\n", &amp;i, &amp;isquared) == 2)
         printf("i: %d,  isquared: %d\n", i, isquared);
   
      /* close the file */
      fclose(fp);
   
      return 0;
   }
</PRE>

We read from the file using the <TT>fscanf()</TT> function which takes as its
first argument the file pointer <TT>fp</TT>.  It works very similarly to
<TT>scanf()</TT> which reads user input from the keyboard.

<P>The <TT>fscanf()</TT> function returns the number of elements read.  
We're reading two elements at a time: a number and its square.  I'm relying on
the fact that if <B>no</B> elements get read it must be because we've reached
the end of the file.  So if the return value of <TT>fscanf()</TT> isn't equal to
two, I close the file and end the program.   Make sense?

<P>One last thing about <TT>fscanf()</TT>.  Why does the format string,
<TT>"%d,%d\n"</TT>, not have the space that is in the <TT>fprintf()</TT> format
string, <TT>"%d, %d\n"</TT>?  It so happens that <TT>%d</TT> skips leading
whitespace if it's there, and if the space is in the format string then the
read will fail if the space is missing, which is a difficult bug to find.

<P><BR><P><H3>Last Notes</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There is <I>much</I> more to reading the writing files in C.  There are
better and less error prone functions to use than <TT>fprintf()</TT> and
<TT>fscanf()</TT>.  However, for our purposes (reading and writing of numbers)
they are sufficient and the easiest to explain.

<P>If there are enough requests, I'll expand this tutorial to talk more about
reading and writing of files in C.

<P>Please send me comments and questions if you still have questions (or even if
you want to tell me the tutorial was good).

<P>Thanks.  :)<BR>
Pete

<h1><strong>History</strong></h1>
<i><blockquote>
Genetic Algorithms were invented to mimic some of the processes observed in natural evolution.
Many people, biologists included, are astonished that life at the level of complexity that we observe
could have evolved in the relatively short time suggested by the fossil record. The idea with GA is
to use this power of evolution to solve optimization problems. The father of the original Genetic
Algorithm was John Holland who invented it in the early 1970's.

<h1><b>What is Genetic Algorithms?</b></h1>

<p><font size="4">
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are adaptive heuristic search algorithm based on the 
evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetics.  As such they represent
an intelligent exploitation of a random search used to solve optimization
problems.  Although randomised, GAs are by no means random, instead they 
exploit historical information to direct the search into the region of better
performance within the search space.  The basic techniques of the GAs are 
designed to simulate processes in natural systems necessary for evolution, 
specially those follow the principles first laid down by Charles Darwin of 
"survival of the fittest.".  Since in nature, competition among individuals 
for scanty resources results in the fittest individuals dominating over the 
weaker ones.

<h1><strong>Why Genetic Algorithms?</strong></h1>

<p>
It is better than conventional AI in that it is more robust.  Unlike older AI
systems, they do not break easily even if the inputs changed slightly, or in
the presence of reasonable noise.  Also, in searching a large state-space,
multi-modal state-space, or n-dimensional surface, a genetic algorithm may
offer significant benefits over more typical search of optimization techniques.
(linear programming, heuristic, depth-first, breath-first, and praxis.)

<h1><strong>Genetic Algorithms Overview</strong></h1>

<p>
GAs simulate the survival of the fittest among individuals over consecutive
generation for solving a problem.  Each generation consists of a population
of character strings that are analogous to the chromosome that we see in our
DNA.  Each individual represents a point in a search space and a possible 
solution.  The individuals in the population are then made to go through a
process of evolution.</p>

<p>GAs are based on an analogy with the genetic structure and behaviour of 
chromosomes within a population of individuals using the following foundations:</p>

<ul>	
<li>	Individuals in a population compete for resources and mates.
</li><li>	Those individuals most successful in each 'competition' will produce more offspring than those individuals that perform poorly.
</li><li>	Genes from `good' individuals propagate throughout the 
population so that two good parents will sometimes produce offspring 
that are better than either parent.
</li><li>	Thus each successive generation will become more suited to their environment.
</li></ul>
<p></p>


<br>
</a><a name="search">
<h3><strong>Search Space</strong></h3>

<p>A population of individualsare is maintained within <strong>search space</strong> for a GA, each representing a possible solution to a given problem. Each individual is
coded as a finite length vector of components, or variables, in terms of some alphabet, usually the <b>binary</b> alphabet <b>{0,1}</b>. To
continue the genetic analogy these individuals are likened to chromosomes and the variables are analogous to genes. Thus a
chromosome (solution) is composed of several genes (variables). A <b>fitness score</b>
 is assigned to each solution representing
the abilities of an individual to `compete'. The individual with the 
optimal (or generally near optimal) fitness score is sought.
The GA aims to use selective `breeding' of the solutions to produce 
`offspring' better than the parents by combining
information from the chromosomes.</p>

<br>
<br>
<center><img src="Introduction%20to%20Genetic%20Algorithms_files/article1_009.gif"></center>
<br>
<p>The GA maintains a population of n chromosomes (solutions) with associated fitness values. Parents are selected to mate,
on the basis of their fitness, producing offspring via a reproductive plan. Consequently highly fit solutions are given more
opportunities to reproduce, so that offspring inherit characteristics from each parent. As parents mate and produce offspring,
room must be made for the new arrivals since the population is kept at a static size. Individuals in the population die and are
replaced by the new solutions, eventually creating a new generation once all mating opportunities in the old population have
been exhausted. In this way it is hoped that over successive generations better solutions will thrive while the least fit
solutions die out.</p>

<p>New generations of solutions are produced containing, on average, more good genes than a typical solution in a previous
generation. Each successive generation will contain more good `partial solutions' than previous generations. Eventually, once
the population has converged and is not producing offspring noticeably different from those in previous generations, the
algorithm itself is said to have converged to a set of solutions to the problem at hand.</p>

<h1><strong>Implementation Details</strong></h1>

<h3><strong>Based on Natural Selection</strong></h3>

	After an initial population is randomly generated, the algorithm evolves
	the through three operators:

<ol>
<li>	<strong>selection</strong> which equates to survival of the fittest;
</li><li>	<strong>crossover</strong> which represents mating between individuals;
</li><li>	<strong>mutation</strong> which introduces random modifications.
</li></ol>
<br>
<br>

</a><a name="selection">
<h3><strong>1. Selection Operator</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>	key idea: give prefrence to better individuals, allowing them to pass on their genes to the next generation.
</li><li>	The goodness of each individual depends on its fitness.
</li><li>	Fitness may be determined by an objective function or by a subjective judgement.
</li></ul>



</a><a name="crossover">
<h3><strong>2. Crossover Operator</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>	Prime distinguished factor of GA from other optimization techniques
</li><li>	Two individuals are chosen from the population using the selection operator
</li><li>	A crossover site along the bit strings is randomly chosen 
</li><li>	The values of the two strings are exchanged up to this point 
</li><li>	If S1=000000 and s2=111111 and the crossover point is 2 then S1'=110000 and s2'=001111
</li><li>	The two new offspring created from this mating are put into the next generation of the population
</li><li>	By recombining portions of good individuals, this process is likely to create even better individuals
</li></ul>
<br>

<center><img src="Introduction%20to%20Genetic%20Algorithms_files/article1_005.gif"></center> 

<br>
</a><a name="mutation">
<h3><strong>3. Mutation Operator</strong></h3>

<ul>	
<li>	With some low probability, a portion of the new individuals will have some of their bits flipped.
</li><li>	Its purpose is to maintain diversity within the population and inhibit premature convergence.
</li><li>	Mutation alone induces a random walk through the search space
</li><li>	Mutation and selection (without crossover) create a parallel, noise-tolerant, hill-climbing algorithms
</li></ul>
<br>

<center><img src="Introduction%20to%20Genetic%20Algorithms_files/article1_008.gif"></center>
<br>

</a><a name="effect">
<h3><b>Effects of Genetic Operators</b></h3> 

<ul>
<li>	Using selection alone will tend to fill the population with copies of the best individual from the population
</li><li>	Using selection and crossover operators will tend to cause the algorithms to converge on a good but sub-optimal solution
</li><li>	Using mutation alone induces a random walk through the search space.
</li><li>	Using selection and mutation creates a parrallel, noise-tolerant, hill climbing algorithm
</li></ul>

</a><a name="algorithms">
<h3><b>The Algorithms</b></h3>
<ol>
<li>	randomly initialize population(t)
</li><li>	determine fitness of population(t)
</li><li>	repeat   
	<ol>	
	<li>	select parents from population(t)
	</li><li>	perform crossover on parents creating population(t+1)
	</li><li>	perform mutation of population(t+1)
	</li><li>	determine fitness of population(t+1)
	</li></ol>
</li><li>	until best individual is good enough

<h1><b>Summary</b></h1>

<p>In previous subsection it has been claimed that via the operations of selection,
crossover, and mutation the GA will converge over successive generations 
towards the global (or near global) optium.  why these simple operation should
produce a fast, useful and robust techiques is largely due to the fact that GAs
combine direction and chance in the search in an effective and efficient manner.
Since population implicitly contain much more information than simply the 
individual fitness scores, GAs combine the good information hidden in a solution 
with good information from another solution to produce new solutions with good
indormation inherited from both parents, inevitably (hopefully) leading towrads
optimality.

</p><p>The ability of the algorithm to explore and exploit simultaneously, a growing 
amount of theoretical justification, and successful application to real-world
problems strengthens the conclusion that GAs are a powerful, robust optimisation
technique.

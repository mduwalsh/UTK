Hi Mahendra,

Write-back and write-through cache designs exhibit different access patterns based on hits and misses so you would not necessarily obtain the exact same miss rates or delays. That is the number of total accesses may differ as well as the frequency of accesses for each cache level.

For example, consider a  write hit in L1 cache,
1. Write-back - simply accesses L1 and performs a single write. (1 write) Does not access lower memory.
2. Write-through - performs a write to L1 and lower memory. (2 writes)

Another example, consider a read miss in L1 cache and the block to use for the read in L1 as dirty,
1. Write-back - writes the dirty block to lower memory, then reads block from lower memory and copies into L1 cache. (2 writes, 2 read)
2. Write-through - reads block from lower memory and copies into L1 cache. (1 write, 1 read)

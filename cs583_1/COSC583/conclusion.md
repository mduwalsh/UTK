### Concusion
From its humble start at Netscape, SSL/TLS has become one of the great pillars
in modern web security.  It is ubiquitous throughout the web and many modern
applications rely on its resilience for protection against man in the middle
attacks and impersonating servers. In spite of several design and
implementation issues, the protocol has proven to be fairly resilient since its
public release in 1999.  SSL/TLS has proven to be an effective and robust
solution to securing a TCP connection from one host to another.

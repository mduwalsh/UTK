If using bitmap,
1st block - Superblock
2nd block - iNode bitmap
3rd block - data bitmap

If using freelist,
Head - Superblock
Superblock points to first inode
Superblock points to first data block
Each free data block points to the next data block


Questions:
How many inodes are we required to support with a 100 MB disk?
- Right now we are sticking with 20.
Should we use a free list or bitmap to track free data blocks?
What should each block size be? Should it expand as a file expands?
